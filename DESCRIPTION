Description: A statistical learning procedure that fits linear interaction
  models by employing gradient boosting and using interaction tree stumps as
  base learner. Interaction tree stumps are decision tree stumps or simple
  linear regression models that model either a marginal or an interaction
  effect. Interaction tree stumps are fitted either using a complete search
  over all possible interaction terms employing a branch and bound technique
  for discarding weakly predictive terms or using a hybrid between a greedy and
  a complete search.
